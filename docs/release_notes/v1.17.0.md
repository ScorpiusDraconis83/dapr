## Highlights
These are the v1.17 release highlights:

### Workflow Versioning

Dapr v1.17 introduces [workflow versioning](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-versioning/), giving developers the tools to safely evolve workflow code while in-flight workflows continue to run correctly. This is critical because Dapr workflows are durable, may run for extended periods, and application upgrades can introduce changes that break deterministic replay of existing workflow instances.
Workflow versioning in Dapr supports two complementary strategies:

- Named workflow versions: Register multiple versions of a workflow under distinct names, allowing new workflow instances to run on the latest version while existing instances continue replaying against their original version. This provides a clean break between workflow implementations, ideal for major refactors.
- Patching: For smaller, incremental changes, patching lets you introduce conditional code branches within a workflow using `ctx.IsPatched("patch_name")`. New executions take the updated code path, while replaying instances follow the original path they were started on. This avoids duplicating entire workflow definitions for minor adjustments.

SDK support is already available in Go, Python, .NET, and Java. Learn more in the [workflow versioning documentation](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-versioning/).

### Workflow State Retention Policy

Dapr Workflows now supports a [history retention policy](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-history-retention-policy/) to help control how much workflow state history is kept in your state store.

By default, workflow execution history is retained **indefinitely**, which is great for auditing and troubleshooting—but can also lead to significant growth in actor state storage for high-volume workloads or workflows that emit lots of state changes.

With v1.17 you can configure how long to retain workflow history after a workflow reaches a terminal state (`Completed`, `Failed`, or `Terminated`). You can set:

- a default retention duration for any terminal state, and

- per-terminal-state overrides (for example, keep `Failed` longer than `Completed`).

Retention durations use Go duration strings (for example `72h`, `30m`).

Example configuration:

```yaml
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: appconfig
spec:
  workflow:
    stateRetentionPolicy:
      anyTerminal: "360h"
      completed: "1m"
      failed: "720h"
      terminated: "360h"
```

Operational tip: a common pattern is to keep `Completed` workflows for a shorter period, while retaining `Failed` and `Terminated` workflows longer to support investigation.

### Placement Service Improvements

In v1.17, the [Placement service](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/placement/) is more robust during deployments, scaling events, and sidecar churn, helping Actors and Workflows converge faster and avoid inconsistent routing decisions.

- Placement now disseminates placement-table updates using a stricter three-stage sequence (lock → update → unlock) across members in a namespace. This eliminates scenarios where some sidecars could temporarily operate on stale placement data, especially when many instances are joining/leaving at once.
- More reliable dissemination under churn: Better handling of rapid connect/disconnect events helps prevent stalls and improves convergence during rolling updates and autoscaling.
- Faster disconnect detection: Placement reacts immediately when a client drops its stream/connection, reducing “ghost member” behavior and shortening recovery time.


### CLI Operational Improvements

The Dapr CLI in v1.17 adds smoother operational workflows for [Workflows](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-workflow/) and [Scheduler](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-scheduler/), plus better defaults for local development.

- Better standalone defaults for remote Actors/Workflows: dapr run now automatically sets `DAPR_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1` when it isn’t already set, improving “works out of the box” behavior in self-hosted mode on MacOS.
- New dapr [workflow management commands](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/howto-manage-workflow/): Run and manage workflow instances from the CLI, including common lifecycle and troubleshooting operations (for example: `list`, `history`, `suspend`/`resume`, `terminate`, `rerun`, `raise-event`, `purge`).

```bash
$ dapr workflow <..>
```

- New dapr [scheduler management commands](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/scheduler/): Inspect and maintain Scheduler entries, including listing and deleting jobs/reminders, plus export/import to move Scheduler data between environments.

```bash
$ dapr scheduler <..>
```

- Fewer required flags for workflow operations: Workflow listing now works out-of-the-box without requiring the CLI to connect directly to the state store database; the --connection-string option remains available for older runtime targets.
- Cleaner operational cleanup: Workflow purge operations now support forcing cleanup when a worker isn’t connected, and are designed to avoid leaving behind related scheduled work.


### Performance Improvements

In Dapr v1.17 made greater use of the performance test suite and added visualizations so you can inspect and compare performance results yourself.

Added a [performance charts directory](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/tests/perf/report/charts) under `tests/perf/report/charts`. It contains chart outputs (ex: duration breakdown, throughput, tail latency, resource usage, etc) generated from our performance runs, organized by API and Dapr version. From there, you can open the API and Dapr version that matches your usage and compare runs or versions relevant to your APIs and workloads. Each API folder for the v1.17 folder contains a highlights section where common scenario performance results are highlighted at the top of each README.

The performance suite runs in CI regularly. Visual charts are created from code, based on runs in Azure. This helps visually highlight regressions or improvements  and provides a single place to see current and historical performance.

Keep in mind that numbers can vary slightly between runs and environments. The figures below are from a comparison of two individual performance runs (one v1.16, one v1.17) - not averaged across multiple runs, so they may not be representative of *every* environment. Below are highlights from our generated v1.16 and v1.17 runs:

| API                                    | v1.16    | v1.17    | % Improvement |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Actor (activation avg latency)         | 2.70 ms  | 2.35 ms  | 13%           |
| Actor (timer with state avg latency)   | 8.20 ms  | 6.84 ms  | 17%           |
| Workflows (throughput: iterations/sec) | 19.80    | 28.01    | 41.5%         |
| Workflows (req duration avg in ms)     | 1467     | 1042     | 29%           |
| Workflows (req duration p90 in ms)     | 1642     | 1166     | 29%           |

**Test references for the numbers above:**
- Actors: `TestActorActivate`
- Workflows: `TestWorkflowWithConstantVUs` with the same scenario (30 VUs, 300s)

Actors show lower latency for activation and timer with state. Because workflows use actors under the hood, you see higher workflow throughput and lower request latency (both average and p90) for the constant VU scenario.

### Bulk Pubsub API is now Stable

After several releases of availability via the Alpha APIs, first introduced in Dapr v1.10.0, [Bulk Publish and Bulk Subscribe](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-bulk/) are now stable in Dapr v1.17.

The stabilization brings production-ready, consistent APIs for Bulk PubSub, allowing you to publish and receive multiple messages in a single operation via the stable APIs:

* Publish endpoint: for HTTP, `/v1.0/publish/bulk/<pubsub-name>/<topic>` was promoted from `/v1.0-alpha1/publish/bulk/<pubsub-name>/<topic>`. For gRPC, `BulkPublishEvent` was promoted from `BulkPublishEventAlpha1`.
* Application callback: `OnBulkTopicEvent` was promoted from `OnBulkTopicEventAlpha1`.

Application code should be updated to implement the stable endpoints/callbacks when using Bulk PubSub. All SDKs are updated accordingly to support and use the stable APIs on both Publish and Subscribe sides. Please check SDK release notes and examples for details.

Backwards compatibility: If your application still implements the previous `OnBulkTopicEventAlpha1` callback, Dapr logs a deprecation warning and automatically falls back to the Alpha APIs (for now), giving you time to migrate to using the stable API. Alpha paths remain functional, but are deprecated in favor of the stable APIs.

This stabilization follows the [Dapr API Lifecycle expectations](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/blob/main/guides/api-design.md), backed by extensive testing ensuring production readiness.

### Workflow Tracing

This release improves end-to-end tracing for Dapr Workflows by ensuring that incoming trace context is preserved when scheduling and executing workflows.

Previously, traces could become disconnected when workflows were scheduled or orchestrations executed, making distributed traces harder to follow. Now workflow spans are correctly linked to the caller’s trace.

### Conversation API Improvements

The [Conversation API](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/conversation/conversation-overview/) received several enhancements in this release to improve reliability, flexibility, and observability.

- Tool/function calling is now fully supported and tested across all components, with additional improvements specific to Ollama.
- Prompt caching has been introduced to improve efficiency—complementing the existing response cache with configurable TTL support.
- Timeouts can now be configured via resiliency policies, and new response formatting options make it easier for downstream consumers to process outputs.
- Responses also include extended metadata, such as usage metrics and model details, enabling improved observability and cost tracking for AI-powered applications.

### Component Improvements

Various component improvements were included in this release, focused on enhanced authentication, resiliency, and feature completeness:
- Apache Pulsar PubSub: new subscription options via metadata, message compression support, and OAuth2 client secret support from file path
- AWS Components + MySQL updated to latest client SDK version with compatibility guaranteed
- SQLServer state component v2 with support for workflows
- SFTP Binding improved concurrency handling for mutex-protected operations
- Redis Streams PubSub honors configured resiliency policies
- Kafka Components:
    - Introduced additional JWT authentication support for Kafka OIDC scenarios
    - JWT audience is now sent as a single string for improved IdP compatibility
    - Optional kid header support in JWT
- Azure Service Bus now respects FIFO ordering guarantees
- PostgreSQL v2 corrected migration schema issues
- All State Components support new KeysLike API, enabling key listing using SQL LIKE-style wildcard patterns
- Conversation Components new features:
    - Added tool call support (Ollama)
    - Introduced prompt caching
    - Response formatting support
    - Resiliency policy timeout respected
    - Extended response metadata to include usage metrics + model used

- [RavenDB State Store](https://v1-17.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-ravendb/)

## SDK Improvements
### Go SDK

- Adds support for `FailurePolicy` on Actor Reminders to allow for controlling the retry behaviour of failed Actor Reminder invocations.
- Exposed the V1 BulkPublish APIs, used as the default over Beta.
- Removes the Workflow wrapper client, in favour of the upstream durabletask-go client.

### .NET SDK

The v1.17 release of the [Dapr .NET SDK](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/dotnet/) features a complete overhaul of the `Dapr.Workflow` package removing all dependencies on DurableTask and updating to support all Dapr runtime functionality: task execution identifiers, multi-app workflows (workflows & activities), and both patch- and name-based workflow versioning.

This release includes official support for .NET 10 in addition to the already supported .NET 8 and 9.

The Conversation API has been updated to reflect the latest runtime capabilities for detailing token usage and specifying both response schema structure and prompt cache durations.

The PubSub API has been updated to reflect the graduation of the bulk PubSub runtime support to stable.

Finally, this release ships Testcontainers support via the `Dapr.Testcontainers` package facilitating integration tests across the SDK and better enabling developers to improve their own testing infrastructure with Dapr.

### Python SDK

The v1.17 release of the Dapr Python SDK introduces two new AI agent framework extensions: `dapr-ext-langgraph` and `dapr-ext-strands`, enabling durable and observable AI agent workflows backed by Dapr's building blocks.

Workflow versioning is now supported with both patch-based and name-based versioning, allowing safe evolution of long-running workflow definitions without breaking in-flight instances.

@sicoyle is now a maintainer and @CasperGN an approver of the python SDK.

### Java SDK

Workflow versioning is now supported with both patch-based and name-based versioning, allowing safe evolution of long-running workflow definitions without breaking in-flight instances.

Spring Boot 4 support has been introduced, as Spring Boot 3 reaches end of support on June 30, 2026.

The Conversation API has been updated to reflect the latest runtime capabilities for detailing token usage and specifying both response schema structure and prompt cache durations.

PubSub API has been updated to reflect the graduation of the bulk PubSub runtime support to stable.

Actor Reminders API has been updated to support failure policies

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.17

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps below to ensure a smooth upgrade.

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init --runtime-version=1.17
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.17) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.17
Runtime version: 1.17
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.17 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.17 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.17 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.17 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.17 -k
```

##### Post Installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.17   15s  2026-02-12 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.17   15s  2026-02-12 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.17   15s  2026-02-12 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.17   15s  2026-02-12 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.17 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Deprecation Notices

Alpha Bulk PubSub APIs are being deprecated in favor of the stable Bulk PubSub APIs. The alpha Bulk Publish and Bulk Subscribe APIs (`/v1.0-alpha1/publish/bulk/<pubsub-name>/<topic>` and `BulkPublishEventAlpha1`) are now deprecated. The app callback `OnBulkTopicEventAlpha1` is also now deprecated.

The alpha APIs remain functional in Dapr v1.17 - Dapr will log a deprecation warning and automatically fallback to them if your application still uses them. This gives users time to migrate to the stable APIs (`/v1.0/publish/bulk/<pubsub-name>/<topic>` and `BulkPublishEvent`) and `OnBulkTopicEvent` for the app callback.

See the section above titled `Bulk PubSub API is now Stable` for full details on the promoted APIs, migration steps, backwards compatibility behavior, and documentation links.
